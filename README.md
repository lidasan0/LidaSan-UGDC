What do you want ot get out of this club? 
  I want to learn, at least, the basics of developing games. In addition, I want to get that feeling for being proud of myself for creating something which everyone can use. This skill will be great in the future since the path I want to study relates to this. Not only that, this will be good experience which I can use in my portfolio later. 

I'm not sure what my hobbie is or even if I have one, but I like playing the guitar in my free time.
